\lecture[]{Th 14 Oct 2021}{$\Delta$-complexes}


\begin{remark*}
    The vertices of $\Delta^n$ are ordered. Thus also $\Delta^n \to X$ specifies this, i.e. the embeddings of $\Delta^2$ into $\mathbb{R}^2$

    \missingfigure{maps}
    are different maps.

    The orders on the boundaries have to agree, e.g. we can view $[0,1]^2$ as

    \missingfigure{unit square ok}

    but not as
    \missingfigure{unit square not ok}.

    This is imposed by the condition that $α \circ  δ^i \in A_{n-1}$: If the order does not agree on the boundary, this implies that we have at least maps from $\Delta^{n-1}$ to the boundary to the boundary, one for each direction, which will violate condition 2) in \autoref{def:delta-complex}.

    To express the ordering of the simplices, in images we will often draw arrows indicating the direction of the corresponding edges, like in the images above.
\end{remark*}

\begin{example}
    Let $T$ be a  torus, realized with three 2-simplices, three 1-simplices and a 0-simplex as a $\Delta$-complex as follows:

    \missingfigure{Torus as delta complex}
    
    Computing the chain complex yields:

    \begin{IEEEeqnarray*}{Cl}
        \Delta_2(T) \cong \Z^2 & ~ ~ \text{(generated by $U, V$)}\\
        \Delta_1(T) \cong \Z^3 & ~ ~\text{(generated by $a,b,c$)}\\
        \Delta_0(T) \cong \Z &  ~ ~\text{(generated by $v$)}
    \end{IEEEeqnarray*}

    For the boundary maps, we get the images:
    \begin{IEEEeqnarray*}{rCl}
        &\partial_2(U) &= b - c + a\\
        &\partial_2(V) &= a - c + b = \partial_2(u)\\
        \implies &H_2^{\Delta}(T) &\cong \ker \partial_2 \cong \Z ~ \text{(generated by $U - V$)}
    \end{IEEEeqnarray*}
    Thus, as $b - c + a = a-c+ b \neq 0\in \Delta_1(T)$, we have:
    \[
        H_2^{\Delta}(T) = \faktor{\ker \partial_2}{\im \partial_3} = \ker \partial_2 \cong \mathbb{Z} \cong \left< U-V \right> 
    \] 

    For the first homology, we get that all boundaries vanish
    \[
        \partial_1(a) = \partial_1(b) = \partial_1(c) = v - v = 0
    \] 
    and hence
    \[
        H_1^{\Delta}(T) \cong \faktor{\ker \partial_1}{\im \partial_2} \cong \faktor{\Z^3}{\im \partial_2} \cong \faktor{\mathbb{Z}^3}{\left< c-a+b \right> } \stackrel{c=a+b}{\cong} \Z^2
    \] 
    Finally, we also get
    \[
        H_0^{\Delta}(T) \cong \faktor{\ker \partial_1}{\im \partial_1} = \faktor{\mathbb{Z}}{0} \cong \mathbb{Z}
    \] 
\end{example}

\begin{oral}
We will observe that $H_0^{\Delta} \cong \mathbb{Z}$ is quite common, namely for connected spaces.

In the example, the groups are torsion-free, however this does not have to be the case in general (in contrast to the chain groups that are free by definition).
\end{oral}

\begin{example}
    Consider the \vocab{figure eight}, namely $S^1 \vee S^1$. We can realize this as a $\Delta$-complex with two 1-simplices and one 0-simplex as follows:
    \missingfigure{delta complex}

    Again, $\partial_1$ is trivial to compute:
     \[
         \partial_1(a) = \partial_1(b) = v - v = 0.
    \] 
    Thus
    \[
        H_n^{\Delta}(S^1 \vee S^1) \cong \begin{cases}
            \Z &\text{if } n = 0\\
            \Z^2 &\text{if } n = 1\\
            0 &\text{if } n \ge 2
        \end{cases}
    \] 
\end{example}

\begin{remark}
    Note that for the Torus, we had  $\pi_1(T) \cong H_1^{\Delta}(T)$, but for $S^1 \twedge S^1$ this did not hold.

    However, in all examples above we have $H_1^\Delta \cong \pi_1^{\text{ab}}$.
    We will see that this holds in general.

    We will further see that $H_n^\Delta$ only depends on the underlying space and not on the $\Delta$-structure. For this we will first generalize homology to all spaces.
\end{remark}

\begin{definition}[Cycles, boundaries]\label{def:cycles-boundaries}
    Elements in $\ker \partial_n \subseteq C_n$ are called \vocab{cycles}.
    Elements in $\im \partial_{n+1} \subseteq C_n$ are called \vocab{boundaries}.
    
    \missingfigure{why are cycles called cycles?}
\end{definition}

\subsection{Semi-simplicial sets}

\begin{oral}
    Semi-simplicial sets are somewhat more abstract. If you don't like that, you can mostly ignore them for the rest of the lecture.
\end{oral}

\begin{definition}\label{def:semi-simplicial-set}
    A \vocab{semi-simplicial set} $S_\chainbullet$ (or $\Delta$-set) is a sequence $(S_n)_{n=0}^\infty$ of sets together with maps
    $d_i : S_{n+1} \to  S_n$ for $i \in  \{0,\ldots, n+1\}$ that satisfy $d_j \circ d_{i} = d_i \circ d_{j+1} ~\forall i \le j$.
\end{definition}

\begin{oral}
    First note that ther really are $n+2$ (potentially different) maps  $S_{n+1} \to  S_n$ that are part of the data of a simplicial set.
\end{oral}

\begin{remark*}
    A semi-simplicial set can also be viewed as a functor, as we will see in \autoref{lm:semi-simplicial-sets-are-equivalent-to-functors-from-delta-inj-prime-to-set}.
\end{remark*}

\begin{example}\label{ex:chain-groups-are-semi-simplicial-set}
Let $X $ be a $\Delta$-complex. Then setting $S_n \coloneqq A_n$ and $d_i$ as the restriction along $\delta^i$ (i.e. $d_i(\alpha) = \alpha \circ \delta^i$) yields a a semi-simplicial set, as we have
    \[
    d_j \circ d_i = d_i \circ d_{j+1} ~ \text{for } i \le j
    \] 
    by \autoref{lm:composition-of-boundary-maps-index-swapping}.
\end{example}

As with the $n$-chains of a  $\Delta$-complex , one can form a chain complex from a semi-simplicial complex as well:

\begin{lemmadef}\label{def:linearization}
    The \vocab{linearization} of $S_\bullet$ is the chain complex $(\Z S_{\bullet}, \partial)$ given by
    \[
        (\Z S)_n \coloneqq \Z \left[ S_n \right] 
    \] 
    (the formal finite linear combinations of the elements of $S_n$)
    and as boundary maps
    \[
        \partial_n \coloneqq \sum_{i=0}^{n} (-1)^i d_i
    \].
    This forms a chain complex, that gives $(\Delta_{\chainbullet}, \partial)$ in the special case of a $\Delta$-complex treated as in \autoref{ex:chain-groups-are-semi-simplicial-set}.
\end{lemmadef}
\begin{proof}
    The chain complex property just follows analoguously to \autoref{lm:composition-of-boundaries-is-zero}, as we just needed the property of \autoref{lm:composition-of-boundary-maps-index-swapping} for its proof and this is just part of the definition of a semi-simplicial set. It is easy to check that this yields $(\Delta_{\chainbullet},\partial)$ in the case of a $\Delta$-complex.
\end{proof}

\begin{definition}[category of ]\label{def:delta-inj-category}
    The category \vocab{$\Delta_{\text{inj}}$} consists of:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item the non-empty, linearly ordered, finite sets as objects
            \item the injective, order-preserving maps between them
        \end{itemize}
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}\label{rm:delta-inj-prime-full-subcategory}
    We can consider the full subcategory $\Delta_\text{inj}'$ of $\Delta_\text{inj}$ on the objects $[n] = \{0,\ldots,n\}$. The inclusion of this subcategory is an equivalence of categories.
\end{remark}

\begin{recap}
    A functor $\mathcal{F}\colon  \mathcat{C}\to \mathcat{D}$ is \vocab{full}, if for each pair of objects $A,B \in \mathcat{C}$, the map of sets
    \[
        \mathcal{F}\colon \Mor_{\mathcat{C}}(A,B) \to  \Mor_{\mathcat{D}}(\mathcal{F}(A),\mathcal{F}(B))
    \] 
    is surjective. $\mathcal{F}$ is called \vocab{faithful}, if this map is injective. A functor that is both full and faithful (meaning above map is a bijection) is also called a \vocab{fully faithful} functor. 

    $\mathcal{F}$ is \vocab{essentially surjective}, if for each $B\in \mathcal{D}$, there is some $A\in \mathcat{C}$ with $\mathcal{F}(A) \cong B$, i.e. it is surjective up to isomorphism (in the category $\mathcal{D}t$).

    If $\mathcal{F}$ is fully faithful and essentially surjective, $\mathcal{F}$ is called an \vocab{equivalence} of categories, we also say that $\mathbb{C}$ and $\mathcat{D}$ are equivalent.

    If you are not familiar with these notions yet, check them in the case of $\Delta_{\text{inj}}'\hookrightarrow \Delta_{inj}$.
\end{recap}

\begin{orga}
    If you don't know what a category is, come to the Q\&A-session on next monday.
\end{orga}

\begin{lemma}\label{lm:semi-simplicial-sets-are-equivalent-to-functors-from-delta-inj-prime-to-set}
    There is a bijection between semi-simplicial sets and functors  $\Delta'_{\text{inj}}{}^\text{op} \to  \Set$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof} % TODO proofidea
    Every morphism $[k] \to  [n]$ in $\Delta'_\text{inj}$ is a composition of morphisms
    of the form $\delta^i = \delta^{ni}: [n-1] \to  [n]$ that send
    $j$ to $j$ for $j < i$.
    $j$ to $j+1$ for $j \ge i$.
    
    This decomposition is unique up to $\delta^i \circ^j = \delta^{j+1} \circ \delta^i ~ \forall i \le j$.

    % TODO: example

    %(If you would want to do this properly, you would have to do some combinatorics).

    Hence a contravariant functor from $\Delta'_\text{inj}$ is determined by a set $S_n$ for each $[n]$ and functions $d_i: S_n \to S_{n-1} ~ \forall i \in  \{0,\ldots,n\}$ 
    % TODO d_i = (\delta^i)^\ast
    with $d_j \circ d_i = d_i \circ d_{j+1} \forall i \le j$.
    This is precisely the datum of a semi-simplicial set.
\end{proof}

\begin{remark}
    $\Fun(\Delta_{\text{inj}}'{}^{\text{op}}, \Set)$ is equivalent to $\Fun(\Delta_\text{inj}^{\text{op}}, \Set)$.
\end{remark}

\begin{definition}
    The \vocab{geometric realization} of a semi-simplicial set $S_{\bullet}$ is the (quotient) space $|S| = \faktor{(\coprod_{n \in  \N_0} S_n \times \Delta^n)}{\sim}$
    where $\sim $ is generated by $(\sigma, \delta^i t) \sim (d_i \sigma, t) ~ \forall \sigma \in  S_n, t \in  \Delta^{n-1}$.
\end{definition}


\begin{lemma}
    For every semi-simplicial set $S_\bullet$ the inclusion induces a bijection (not homeomorphism!) 
    \[
    \coprod_{n \in  \N_0} S_n \times \Delta^{\circ n} \to  | S|
    \] 
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
    For every $(s,t) \in  S_n \times  \Delta^n$ $t$ is contained in the interior of a unique  $k$-face of $\Delta^n$ (maybe $k = n$ ).
    Let $f: \Delta^k \to  \Delta^n$ be the inclusion of this face and let $y \in \Delta^k$ such that $f(y) = t$. 
    For  $f = \partial^{i_1} \circ \ldots \circ \partial^{i_k}$ let $f^{\ast} \coloneqq d_{i_k} \circ \ldots \circ d_{i_1} : S_n \to  S_k$.

    Then $(s,t) \sim (f^\ast s , y)$.
    Thus the map is surjective.

    Injectivity: For a given $(s,t)$ $f$ and $y$ are unique
    If $(s,t) = d_i s',t) \sim  (s', \delta^i t)$ then $(s', \delta^i t) = s', (\delta^i \circ f)(y)) \cong ((f^\ast \circ d_i)(s'), y) = (f^\ast s, y)$.
    Similarly, if $(s,t) = s, \delta^i t') \sim  (d_i s, t')$.
    Then there exists $f': \Delta^k \to  \Delta^{n-1}$ with $\delta^i \circ f' = f$
    and thus  $(d_i s, t') = d_i s, f'(y)) \sim (f'{}^\ast d_i s, y) = (f^\ast s,y)$ % TODO ??
\end{proof}
\begin{corollary}
     The realization of a semi-simplicial set is a $\Delta$-complex.
\end{corollary}
\begin{proof}
    1) \& 2) follow from bijectivity in the lemma 1.28 % TODO.
    3) follows from $(s, \delta^i t) \sim  (d_i s, t) $ % TODO in s_n-1
    4) follows from the definition of the quotient topology.
\end{proof}

\begin{remark} % 1.30
    If the semi-simplicial set comes from a $\Delta$-complex, its realization is homeomorphic to the $\Delta$-complex.
\end{remark}
