\begin{orga}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item All lectures will be recorded and uploaded to eCampus afterwards.
    \item The same holds for all written lecture notes (from the iPad).
    \item Daniel is happy if you turn on your camera, these will not be recorded
    \item If you have questions, feel free to ask them at any time. Beware that your voice / question will be recorded
    \item It is not yet know whether the exam at the end of the semester will be in person or online.
    \item You can also ask questions in the chat (these will not be recorded) if you prefer so.
    \item There is an question session on Monday, 10. You can ask questions there, but there will also be questions asked to the students that are to be solved 'live'.
    \item On next monday, we will quickly summarize the basics of category theory
    \item You need 50\% of the points obtainable from the exercise sheet to be admissible to the exam.
    \item For everything taking place at the university (question session or exercise groups) you are required to fullfill the 3G rule: be vaccinnated against, recovered from or testet for the coronavirus.
    \item If you did not attend the course on 'Geometrie und Topologie' the last semester, you can have a look at the lecture notes \cite{geotopo}. These are in german, though. You can also visit the corresponding \href{https://ecampus.uni-bonn.de/goto_ecampus_crs_2122054.html}{eCampus course} or the \href{http://www.math.uni-bonn.de/people/daniel/2021/geotopo/}{webpage}.
    \item If you want to write a bachelor thesis in topology, during one of the lecture times in January, all the topology group members will be present and present a number of topics for a Bachelor thesis. So don't ask yet for possible topics.
    \item Exercise sheets can be handed in groups of up to 3 people. Everyone is required to understand all the solutions
    \end{itemize}

\section{Motivation for this lecture}

Last semester we had a look at
\begin{itemize}
    \item basic properties of topological spaces (e.g. Hausdorff or compact spaces)
    \item The fundamental group of a topological space, coverings to compute it
    \item Fundamental results we proved were:
        \[
            \pi_1(S^1,1)\cong \mathbb{Z} \qquad \pi_1(S^n, s_0) = 0 \qquad \forall n\geq 2
        \] 
\end{itemize}

We aim to kind of generalize this to higher n, one can in fact define
\[
    \pi_n(X,x_0) = [(S^n,s_0), (X,x_0)]
\] 
but these are very hard to compute and do not behave as one would possibly expect from a generalization, e.g. it holds
\[
    \pi_3(S^2,s_0) \cong \mathbb{Z}
\] 
We will consider \vocab{homology} instead. Homology is much harder to define than the higher homotopy groups, but will be much easier to compute.

\begin{warning}
    We will consider $R$-modules in this course. If you are not familiar with them, just tell Daniel or ask questions at any time.
\end{warning}
For now, just think of modules as a sort of vector space, but over a ring $R$, not a field  $K$.

At the start we will only consider $\mathbb{Z}$-modules, i.e. abelian groups.


\section{$\Delta$-complexes \& semi-simplicial sets}
\subsection{$\Delta$-complexes}

\begin{definition}[simplex]\label{def:simplex}
    The \vocab{$n$-simplex} is the space
    \[
        \Delta^n = \left \{(t_0,\ldots,t_n)\in \mathbb{R}^{n+1} \mid  \sum_{i=0}^n t_i = 1, t_i \geq  0\right\} 
    \]
    That is, $\Delta^n$ is the convex subspace of  $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ spanned by
    \[
        e_0 =(1,0,\ldots,0), \ldots, e_n = (0,0,\ldots,1)
    \] 
\end{definition}

\begin{example}
\item $\Delta^0$ is just a point.
\item  $\Delta^1$ is the unit interval via the embedding
        \begin{equation*}
        \begin{array}{c c l} 
            \left[0,1\right] & \longrightarrow & \mathbb{R}^2 \\
            t & \longmapsto &  te_0 + (1-t)e_1
        \end{array}
    \end{equation*}
\end{example}
\todo{number the example}

\begin{definition}\label{def:face}
    \begin{itemize}
\item
    For a subset $I\subset \left \{0,\ldots,n\right\} $ consider the subspace
    \[
        \left \{(t_0,\ldots,t_n) \in \Delta^n \mid  t_i = 0 \; \forall i \in I\right\} 
    \] 
    This is called a \vocab{face} of or also $(n-\abs{I} )$-face of $\Delta^n$.

\item     For $0\leq i\leq n$ define
        \begin{equation*}
        \delta^i = \delta^{n,i}: \left| \begin{array}{c c l} 
        \Delta^{n-1} & \longrightarrow & \Delta^n \\
        (t_0,\ldots,t_{n-1}) & \longmapsto &  (t_0,\ldots,t_{i-1},0,t_i,\ldots,t_{n-1})
        \end{array} \right.
    \end{equation*}

    $\delta^i$ is the \vocab{inclusion} of the $i$th face of  $\Delta^n$
\item The \vocab{boundary} $\partial\Delta^n$ of $\Delta^n$ is the union of the highest dimensional faces, i.e.
     \[
         \partial\Delta^n \coloneqq  \bigcup_{i=0} ^n \im δ^i = \left \{(t_0,\ldots,t_n) \in \Delta^n \mid  \exists i\colon  t_i = 0\right\} 
    \] 
\item The \vocab{interior} of $\Delta^n$ is defined as
    \[
        {\Delta^n}\degree \coloneqq  \Delta^n \setminus \partial\Delta^n
    \] 
    \end{itemize}
\end{definition}
\begin{remark}
    I will fix the notation of the interior soon.
\end{remark}
\todo{notation for the interior}

\begin{definition}
    A  \vocab{$\Delta$-complex} is a topological space $X$ together with the following structure:

    For all $n\in \mathbb{N}_0$, there is a set $A_n = \left \{α\colon  \Delta^n \to  X\right\} $ such that
    \begin{enumerate}[1)]
        \item $\forall α\in A_n$, the restriction $α\mid _{{\Delta^n}\degree}$ is injective
        \item $\forall x\in X$, there is a unique pair  $(n,α)$ with  $n\in \mathbb{N}_0$ and $α\in A_n$ such that $x\in α\mid _{{\Delta^n}\degree}$ 
        \item $\forall α\in \Delta^n$ and $i\in \left \{0,\ldots,n\right\}$ we have $α \circ  \delta^i \in  A_{n-1}$.
        \item A subset $U\subset X$ is open iff
            \[
                α^{-1}(U) \subset \Delta^n \text{ is open } \forall n\in \mathbb{N}_0, α\in A_n
            \] 
    \end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

\begin{oral}
    The last property essentially tells us that you can recover the topology on $X$ from the sets of maps $A_n$.
\end{oral}

\begin{example}
    Considering the torus as a quotient from $I^2$ (the unit square).

    \missingfigure{Torus as a $\Delta$-complex}

    Inserting a diagonal into the unit square realizes the torus as a $\Delta$-complex with two 2-simplices (namely the two triangles), three 1-simplices (the diagonal, and the two pairs of opposite sides of the square) and one 0-simplex (the corners of the square that are glued together)
\end{example}
