# Topology I

These are my lecture notes for the 'Topology I', taught by [Daniel Kasprowski](http://www.math.uni-bonn.de/people/daniel/) in the summer term 2021 at the University of Bonn. There is no guarantee for completeness or correctness.

- The homepage of the course can also be found [here](http://www.math.uni-bonn.de/people/daniel/2021/topo1/)
- The [most recent version](https://kesslermaximilian.github.io/TopologyI/2021_Topology_I.pdf) of this script is made available with [Travis CI](https://github.com/traviscibot). You can also have a look at the [generated log files](https://kesslermaximilian.github.io/TopologyI/2021_Topology_I.log)

# Contribute
I am glad for corrections or even contributions of any kind to improve these lecture notes. Feel free to send pull request / use the Issues feature here on GitHub or send me corrections / suggestions via Mail.

It would be especially nice if there was someone willing to draw some figures, as I do not have time for these. Just copy-pasting the handdrawn ones of Daniel into the notes would also be nice for a start, so that one does not need to have a look at the uploaded notes in parallel all the time. If you want to do so, write me a mail.
